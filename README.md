## Abstract
These are codes for course project of VE444 Networks, UM-SJTU JI, partially adapted from CS224 Machine Learning with Graphs, Standford. In this prohect, we are exploring on network methods for online video recommendation. There are basically 2 ways under consideration:
- Link prediction.
  For a video entry, creating new relevant videos based on existing ones.
- Social recommendation.
  Precit a user's preferences based on the preferences of those who have ralationships with him/her.
